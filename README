This is an experimental Arch install script with a whiptail based GUI, make sure your HDD is formatted and mounted to /mnt and if you are using UEFI make sure your EFI/ESP partition is mounted at /mnt/boot/efi. This only supports CA_UTF-8 English Locale with EST as the timezone for now. Once that is done, clone the repo and run Arch_Installer.sh something like: pacman -S git && git clone https://github.com/Vthyarilops/arch-install.git && cd arch-install && ./Arch_Installer.sh
